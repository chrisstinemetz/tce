Cisco Webex meetings provides the solution to collaborate over video media while allowing the capability to chat and share content. 

## Pricing placeholder

As seen in the above video, webex meetings also integrates into *Atlassian Jira* which is a collaborative platform that enabling a team to plan, track, and manage **agile** software development projects. 

Take aways:
1. Meetings are initiated in *Jira*
2. Meetings are automatically tracked in *Jira*   
* This could be very useful for reporting and tracking communication for team members. Not only can you view how often meetings are conducted you can also see what topics were discussed and what the objectives are for the meetings.
